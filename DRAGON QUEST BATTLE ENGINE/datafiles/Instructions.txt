-To add a new sprite for a enemy you just gotta drag and drop the image to this root, -where this text file is-, then write the exact name of the file without the extension in the correspondent sprite .csv column.
	-Recomendation: No more than 40x60 & use a resolution divisible by 2 in the X axis, nothing will happen if you don't but the sprites might be xOffset in the screen.
			If you're going to place just one enemy in the room maybe you can make a bigger sprite for it idk, experiment with the values, that's up to you.
